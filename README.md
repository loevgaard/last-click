# Last Click - Save the last external website your visitors clicked
The name 'last click' comes from marketing terms where the last click refers to the last external website a user clicked before arriving on your website.

That external website is what we try to figure out and save in this library.

## Installation
```bash
$ npm install last-click
```

## Usage
```javascript
const lastClick = require('last-click')();
```
